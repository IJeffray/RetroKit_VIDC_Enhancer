The Ultra VIDC Enhancer provides support for up 
to three extra clock signals to be added to an A300,
A400, A400/1 or A3000 series Archimedes computer.

This allows these Archimedes to match and surpass the 
video output capabilities of the later A30x0, A4000 
and A5000 computers if the third oscillator is fitted.

The Sync on Green fix is also in place and this board
can be used as a direct replacement for the Retro-Kit
VIDC Enhancer board.

==============================

PL1 provides a SYNC on GREEN disconnect for 
	A300,400 and 400/1 based Arcs 

For the A300 and A400 series

400/1 - always made
3/400 - open/closed 

For the A400/1 series

400/1 - open/closed
3/400 - always made

For the A3000 series

Both connections should be made if fitted in the riser configuration.

==============================

CN1 - Aux Power connector for non-riser configuration
CN2 - Aux I/O - Controlling the selection of VIDC clock speed
CN3 - VIDC Clock I/O - Input: 24MHz VIDC clock 
		 - Output: 24, 25.175, 36.000MHz and custom clock speeds.

==============================

IC1 - 74ACT153N

IC2 will either be a 74LS05 or SN7438 depending on 
	the Archimedes being a 300/400 series or 
	a 400/1 series.

	For A3000's no riser or chip is required.

==============================

Custom oscillator - This can be an oscillator you're 
	happy with for overclocking the VIDC at. 
	If you do not wish to overclock the VIDC 
	chip, use a 220R resistor in its place 
	across pins 4 and 5 as a pull-down resistor.

Parts List
=============

IC1	74ACT153N
IC2	SN7438 or 74LS05 depending on the Archimedes to be fitted to.
C1-4	100nF
R1-3	68R 0.25W

QG1	25.175MHz oscillator (half-can through hole)
QG2	36.000MHz oscillator (half-can through hole) - a 40.000MHz oscillator may also be used but the VIDC chip will require cooling
QG3	reserved for over clocking (half-can through hole custom oscillator) *

* Alternatively, a 220R resistor can be fitted 
	from 0v to the oscillator out connection as a pull-down

CN1	(optional) Power input connector (required for A3000)
CN2-3	90-deg headers

PL 1	2x 2way header (not required for A3000)

Sockets	
=============

1x 14-way DIL turned pin socket (not required for A3000)
1x 16-way DIL turned pin socket (optional)

2x 7-way round male header SIL pins (not required for A3000)
